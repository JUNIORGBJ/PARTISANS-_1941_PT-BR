...that you put the prisoners up to a riot. What are you trying to do?
On the 7th of November a military parade was held in Red Square in Moscow. Straight after the parade, soldiers were shipped to the frontlines.

[As good as done, Herr Kommandant!]
[What a stupid Ivan!]
[Get up and work!]
[I said, on your feet!]
[Keep your eyes peeled.]
[It's a beauty, I tell you! There's a reason they call it Slender Bertha!]
[The barrel is 21 meter long! The caliber is 28 cm, shooting range is 86 kilometers!].
[It took us a while to catch these two in the forest, Herr Kommandant.]
[Captain Zorin. I've been informed...]
[Name? Where are your parents?]
[Major, I'm about to get jealous!]
[Find and shoot the fugitives. No one must get away.]
[We're under attack! Send in reinforcements! Send in everyone!]
[Hiding out in trenches, like rats.]
[Get another fuel can!]
[They're always screaming so much...]
[What stupidity! Take him outside to the firing squad.]
[The partisans might still be here.]
[Split up. Scour the village and the forest.]
[Affirmative! Soldiers, with me!]
[Go away or I'll shoot you.]
[Go away.]
[Oh no, my dear! You're no less slender and charming! ]
[It's them? Why are they dressed so strange?]
Where's that?
And my dad was a full-time drunk until he got stabbed. I were about your age.
The fugitives will hide in the woods and become partisans.
Is it a big station?
But instead just dumped guns there.
And second, a criminal record doesn't necessarily mean that he can't be trusted.
He's a good person. He used to organize sports groups for young pioneers.
My mama tells me that snitching is bad.
Must have had your eyes closed!
Anisimov's partisan unit wrecked several tanks with nothing but crowbars!
Where's the enemy?
And what's the real story?
Really? I can tell something’s bothering you.
You're not actually going to take it?
What about you? Aren't you coming with us?
The causeway is just outside the village. Take the backyards but don’t get spotted. Sanek will show you the rest of the way.
How far are the frontlines?
We didn't have children. But I took Sanek under my wing.
Are they giving us any food today?
If it’s like that, we might as well go capture a Fascist and make him talk!
But if I fail, I marry him. And I aced them all!
The artillery is the god of war.
The villagers will take care of Comrade Kulagin.
Besides, you're the best choice.
And then the SS-men came...
As for that third bastard, I have my own score to settle with him.
Eat that!
Tell me what you did with Zobel!
Of course. All my notes are in the map case.
I wish I had good news but I don't. They took some partisans in Zaborovka yesterday.
And the key is nowhere to be found.
And when the bastards dozed off, two partisans sneaked up to the tanks and shoved crowbars into the barrels.
The Commandant is already acting like a landowner, isn't he?
A Lesgaft man? What's that?
Competitions? Do you have medals?
Take me with you! I know how to hide. And I know how to shoot.
The little one has just started her first grade at school.
Do I look like care? It's your responsibility, so deal with it!
Should we hit 'em now?
Any way to get him that signal earlier? We're in a hurry.
This time, there's much more at stake than a handful of civilians.
Then it's convenient that our planes wiped them out!
The pink, the blue, and the violet true...
We're all asleep at night!
Hush now. I'd like to see you go bag yourself one, scallywag...
Shut your holes! Arbeiten!
Bring it over! I'm asking nicely.
Shush! We'll take some time to settle and send out a scout.
Have you considered the consequences the locals would have to face?
I proved myself during the breach of the Mannerheim Line.
They pay enough to cover your bread and butter.
I think you're a great quartermaster! What would we do without you?
Explosions cause a lot of noise.
Are Polizei the same as Militsiya?
May I take a closer look?
The Commandant with a squad finished what the Polizei started—and wiped out the village.
Why is he alone here? Did they all get killed?
And we’re up against an army of well-fed, healthy, and above all trained fighting units.
What about the door? It's locked, there's no way in, and the village is swarming with Polizei.
So, I found a grenade! It was only right to set a trap on the road. Who knew I'd get a bear instead of a rabbit?
What do you care? Want to sell me off to the Commissar?
I don't know if I’ll ever get to see him again.
Well, now they want to fix it and send back into battle. We must blow it up while it's still here!
We can use it now. I'll have him spilling all the news over a drink.
You'll see in a couple of days when the village has been reduced to embers.
What are you so happy about, knucklehead? We won't get away, either.
