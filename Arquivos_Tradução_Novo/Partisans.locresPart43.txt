Olya, your eyes are red. Are you okay?
He's the Fascists' head executioner! There are rumors about him that'll make your hair stand on end!
I’d get him talking!
It's outside the repair shop. The area is well-guarded.
He wouldn't blow up a convoy, it's too risky.
He left the station early. So he survived the air strike.
That's him. His gang burned down a village recently.
He went that way!
It will mark the anniversary of the Great October Revolution. There are two main objectives.
Did they torture you?
Aren't they going to avenge their own?
They call themselves partisans and claim to be fighting the enemies of the people!
They're going to execute us!
That's us. We want a look at the tank.
They leveled everything! Zobel will pay!
They found out he was a Great War hero and set him free.
Screw me! A mine!
We're dangerously close.
A nasty wound...
Got to respect the sappers.
Danger!
Not hide-and-seek again...
My joints are aching.
More bloodstains to wash off...
And here we go into the bushes again.
Not another wound!
The goal of the operation is to weaken the Fascists' logistics and provide support for the Red Army. But, above all, it will boost morale before a decisive battle.
Leave him be, girl. You can't help him.
Watch out for mines!
Got to be careful.
Careful now!
Steer clear of it.
Can't hide anything from you, Vasily Gavrilovich, right?
You could never pay me off with your Ukrainian pork fat.
Get off me, or else!
Eat some buckshot!
Get off me!
Take a break from life.
My dad was an engineer in a workshop just like this.
Where are you from?
Why are there so many SS soldiers here? They're supposed to be on the front.
Alright, we've got the papers. We can pull out now.
Nice. We sure can use this.
Good. They’re the papers that we need. We can head back to the base now.
Alright, take us there.
Perfect. Get some sleep. Tomorrow is a big day.
Good. Hand them over.
We're taking it to the base. We'll clean it, mend it, and keep it in the Red corner.
We must avenge our comrades!
Let the hostages go! We surrender!
At least, let the children go!
He's like a son to me, pride and joy.
Hold it!
Stand down. I'll carry him.
There's no turning back: there's a minefield behind us. We'll have to fight our way through!
There's no falling back!
Should I him aside?
Enough is enough!
Officer
My back is going to hate me for this.
Uh... I’m wounded.
Damn... I didn’t plan on dying here.
No weather can stop a hunter.
Guard
Does it hurt?
I sure hope so. Small groups have a better chance of escaping undetected.
I wouldn't be so sure. We'll be chasing you all the way back to Berlin before long.
Fascist scum!
Busted!
They're watching!
One goes down, while the other goes up!
Partisan units’ actions successfully undermined the enemy's forces and disrupted their plans.
Partisanen vill come for grain. You must be prepared.
Partisans are scary!
They're transporting the Party's archives. Classified documents, not some old newspapers, you know!
A kid dropped by the other day asking for bread.
This spells trouble.
Out of ammo.
Interpreter 
Can't reload my gun.
Got no ammo to reload.
Please, stop.
It's fenced-off and well-guarded.
Pilot
War heroes don't cry.
A rain cape would come in handy.
Prisoner
Take no prisoners!
Bad news. When the bridge at Volkovo blew, an SS squad went up with it. Everyone's dead.
Nothing good. First came the Polizei. They combed the houses and took away everything of value.
You make it sound like resistance is pointless! I’ve heard that tune before!
My accent betrays me, huh?
She didn't have to worry. She thought that we went to feed the ducks at a local pond.
What does it matter?
You know, I really wanted to finish my studies. I was into my last year.
Victory is ours.
We won!
I was born for sunny days!
You were lucky I didn't have the time to pay you a visit, Vasily Gavrilovich.
I can't believe it...
They're going to hang her now. Maybe, do worse things to her first.
You live long enough to see war, revolution, and famine all in your lifetime. Then we'll talk again.
