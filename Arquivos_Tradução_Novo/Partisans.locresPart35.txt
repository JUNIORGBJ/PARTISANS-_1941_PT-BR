All humans are born equal. But you, Hitler's filth, you aren't human.
Is everyone okay?
Alright, we can pass now.
Enough for everyone.
Get down!
I reckon you've had enough?
My trenchcoat looks like a sieve.
My life flashed before my eyes.
The fog is like cold soup.
Everything goes even worse than we expected.
Why don't we knock on his door, see how the old man is doing? He might treat us to something.
I... can't... Too tired...
Whatever we have is in storage. Kulagin will show you around. He's responsible for the supplies.
Pretty much everything we need and in a nice location! Let's take a look.
You got me! Scum!
Your second objective is to hunt down and kill the treacherous village head. He must be somewhere inside the village.
Ta-daaa!
I saw a tank delivered to the repair yard at the crossroad. I thought you might find it interesting.
Yesterday we eliminated the Bogachevo Commandant whose band of thugs had been tormenting the area.
You see Russian soldiers?
You see any strangers?
You’re like a sparrow sitting on a flawless war machine—you don’t really believe you can stop us?
Yeah, you say that, but you haven't tried it.
Are you in charge here? We must hide the grain in the forest.
Do you know some of the resistance fighters? Where can we find them?
Do you know where the enemy are coming from?
Have you been waiting for us?
You didn't tell me about the operation in honor of the Great October Revolution.
You took it heroically! I couldn't have held out like that.
You acted in accordance with the law. That is more than enough for me.
You're approaching the village Pokrovskoye. Your objective is to gain entry to the armory and find the weapons delivery papers.
You once mentioned that justice was above everything else.
You're committing a war crime!
You stay here, guard ze mines!
You're neither a medic nor a nurse, that's for sure. The first thing a communications officer would ask about is our radio...
Have you decided your next missions? Are you staying here? Or will you cross the frontlines?
Are you okay?
Partisans?
You're Alexey Zorin, the commander of a partisan unit operating behind enemy lines, inside the German-occupied areas of the Pskov district.
You must be here to avenge your comrades?
Are you perchance the daughter of Colonel Belozerov, currently defending Moscow?
I'll whip you.
Help our comrade!
Let's find out what's cooking around here and go from there.
Where does it hurt?
Where can we get some explosives?
Where else did you serve time, Morozov?
Where do you live now that the village is in ruins, Vasily Gavrilovich?
We'll let 'em have it!
Where was it? I'll tell you where! It was running with its tail between its legs!
Where did you live before the war?
There's a Fascist thug in the area.
The Fritz is no fool. They know where we'll strike.
Goddamn hero.
And we cannot afford to get noticed. They see us, we're dead.
Not too shabby.
Staying alert.
Look, Comrade Captain! There's been an accident.
And then we'll talk about what’s a problem and what isn’t.
I am all ears.
Marksmanship solves everything.
I have a sore throat.
I could use a drink.
So a city boy, huh?
My god! We must do something!
What are you suggesting?
Done!
He's dead. Now we can take our leave.
It's a risk that has to be taken.
"Hope for the best, plan for the worst."
Argh.
Argh... alright, let's go, Commissar. Don't try anything funny, and no one gets hurt.
Civilians! They have no idea about discipline! All they care about is revenge.
Grigory showed us what he's capable of. It was me who invited him to join our group.
Grigory, isn't it the very same prison you were locked in?
A formidable tank, but it's no match for our T-34.
Whoa, a lot of people! No peace for an old man.
Nope, don't think I have... Why? Who are you looking for? It might jog my memory...
Here and there, you know. Been all over the country.
He looks a bit shady, if you ask me. Is he even a Commissar at all? I think he's a mole.
Argh! How the hell?..
I've no family. My wife died a long ago, bless her soul. I've noone else.
There’s no stopping us!
Not really. Unlike Krasnoselskaya, which is a major comms hub.
Leave him be. Thieves do have a code, you know? He’ll keep his word.
I'm sure he only said it as a joke.
Ah... Just daydreaming.
This isn't a hunter's shelter, it's partisan headquarters!
I'm right here.
What do you want?
Just look at it! The Division banner, riddled with bullets and stained in soot! You can tell it's seen some battles.
He should have kept his fists to himself.
We have.
Yes, Comrade Commander?
Yes, it’s not looking good... Let's see what we can do for the Motherland together, eh?
That's right. Walk with me.
Yeah, I... Yikes! Look!
Eh?
Yes?
Let me fix you up.
Here's what we're going to do. Let's wait for him. If he doesn't show up, we'll start the search tomorrow.
Go ahead, you bastard! Shoot! There's a hundred and seventy million of us. You can't shoot everyone.
