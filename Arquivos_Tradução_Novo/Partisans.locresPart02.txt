[What?]
[Poor Fleabag!]
[Incoming!]
[This'll keep me warm on duty.]
[Attack!]
[Get out of the way!]
[Take cover!]
[Dive for cover! Now!]
[Look out!]
[Tough luck, it's water.]
[At ease!]
[Here's the main target!]
[Now you're making me real angry!]
[Damn!]
[The enemy's around!]
[The enemy's around! Watch out!]
[Let's move out, everybody!]
[Everybody listen!]
[Everything's quiet.]
[Let's move out!]
[I didn't even feel that.]
[I'm moving!]
[If we don't find anyone, I'll make sure you rot in extra guard duty.]
[Another notch on my belt.]
[Hold position!]
[Vergissmeinnicht...]
[Coming to the rescue!]
[Search!]
[Ready for battle!]
[To battle!]
[Just a mosquito bite!]
[Who's there?]
[Who killed the dog?]
[Get this!]
[I need a medic!]
[Changing my clip.]
[Changing position! Cover me!]
[Changing target!]
[Is it me, or is it...?]
[It's okay to relax now.]
[Junk.]
[We can win!]
[Let's avenge him!]
[I hope it isn't Heinrich.]
[I really hope it hurts.]
[I hope this is another drill.]
[Find the one who did this!]
[Find the bastards!]
[Can't come out!]
[The training has paid off.]
[It wasn't nothing!]
[No time to relax!]
[Not a big deal.]
[Search this area!]
[Just another day far behind the lines.]
[Is he still alive?]
[Gun up!]
[Look around!]
[Watch out!]
[Lights out!]
[Fire!]
[Awesome.]
[Stand down!]
[Can't get them from here.]
[I'm out of bullets. Cover me.]
[Smells like water.]
[Things are getting fuzzy...]
[Reloading.]
[Under fire! Cover me!]
[I'm under heavy fire!]
[You look suspicious.]
[I'm going to puke...]
[Just rest now.]
[Probably nothing.]
[Affirmative, moving out.]
[Beat it!]
[Prepare for battle!]
[Cover me! Reloading.]
[I'll shoot you.]
[Check that out!]
[That was too easy.]
[Disperse!]
[There's nothing medicine can do.]
[Sucker!]
[Don't move, or I'll shoot!]
[Halt!]
[Halt! That's an order!]
[Shoot when you're ready!]
[You can't be here.]
[This is what I'll do to all of you.]
[A little to the left now.]
[Who the hell are you?]
[We've got casualties!]
[They've got men down.]
[Kill them!]
[Kill the Russian!]
[If I ever see you drunk on duty, I'll shoot you.]
