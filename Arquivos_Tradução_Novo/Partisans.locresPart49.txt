It's my fiancée Nastya. Look. Isn't she a beauty?
The rats must have gone underground.
Robbing decent people.
Frau Bertha...?
The Fascists left us a surprise.
Need to wipe down my palms!
Phew, that’s much better.
Woah... One last house to go.
Halt!
We've spiced up their lunch. Now let’s distract them!
Huh... well, thanks.
Quit sobbing. Your old man had it coming.
Yet you speak like you're from a city.
You could have made a great investigator, did you know that?
Eh, life is full of wonders.
I think I walked into something.
Something tells me that it was you, who blew up the bridge together with the SS soldiers.
Headquarters is overwhelmed by messages from the front, so... No promises.
Duh, alright. You're never going to leave me alone are you.
Hm...
Hmm... These things can happen. Did he tell you where exactly he was going to hunt?
Hmm... I'll be back with you as soon as these people are safe.
Hm... if you insist. But you should know that this is classified information.
Hm... we could give that a go if we come across another tank.
Hm... They’ll still have to clear out for now. But they won't be staying there over winter. We'll see to that.
We'll spend the night here and leave in the morning. Sanek mentioned a dugout in the forest.
Yea!
A commissar should have done better!
Good idea. I like it.
A dark night is a good night.
Good day to be outside.
It's a good day for a victory.
The Sergeant is a good man. Just a little too overzealous.
I like it here. We’re surrounded by forests and swampland. Even the devil himself couldn’t pick his way through these wilds, never mind the Germans.
I'm glad there aren't any civilians at the station. I could never forgive myself if anything happened to them.
Okay.
Good. People will be able to come back once we’ve finished off the remaining tyrants.
If you'll have me.
I wish I could agree with you, but it isn't all that heroic in real life.
But it’s actually not such a bad idea.
I want to go there, see the Red Square!
Hungrig. Bitte. Zu essen.
Hände hoch!
Moscow is planning an operation with heavy partisan involvement.
Church
What now?
Guess what? It's a mine, dammit!
Got yourself some trouble, huh?
What do you need us to do?
There's the curfew. What else is there to do?
Stop spreading panic.
Why did I even get involved?
What? Why?
The quicker we win this war, the sooner you'll find out how your sweetheart is.
For all I know, he could be a General!
I'm spotted! Damn it!
Damn, it's the Germans! Someone must have seen us.
Argh, I chipped a nail.
I'm surprised you chose a known criminal to come and save us from the Gestapo.
An honest thief! I respect the code and kill only Fascists.
Clean and smooth.
Why, what's wrong with you you?
What are you doing? This is a hospital! These people are civilians!
Why are you giving me the eye, Trofim Matveevich?
Oh, please, Fräulein. I am not a soldier, I am a mere bureaucrat. You, on the other hand, are a wild animal! Two.
Now what?
What else?
What's it gonna be?
This day just keeps on giving.
Very well. Try not to get shot, though. Who are you, anyway?
What took you so long?
I can't help but notice that you're always in a black mood, Trofim.
What's taking them so long?
Surely, you could have been more careful?
What has got into people's heads, son?
I can't believe people in the village wouldn't even spare a crumb of bread for an orphan.
Why did this happen?
Who's Biermeier? Some big cheese?
What do I do?
Hide-and-seek is for children.
What is he doing? They'll never set the hostages free!
What about the others? We need to find them and get out of here.
What's the noise? Where's the Commander?
I say, you won't see the sunrise.
What did you say?
What's up?
Who are these "Polizei", Sanek? They speak Russian and they look pretty local.
What's that picture you can't stop looking at?
Impressed, huh? You're not the only one with achievements. Master of shooting sports, at your service.
I see you got clipped?
Huh...? Me too?
Tell you what?
Huh? You’re inviting a criminal to join you? Hey... why not?
Do you need anything?
What?
We need somewhere to make us makeshift grenades and bandages.
We must kill the Commandant and two other commanding officers to inflict the maximum damage.
We'll make it look like a partisan raid so they don't suspect anything.
If it isn't fixed within an hour, I’ll charge you with sabotage!
I have a feeling that they can call on whoever they want to hang a partisan these days.
What's that shadow? Phew, it's just my imagination.
Shush...
