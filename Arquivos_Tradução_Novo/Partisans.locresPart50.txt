Stay low!
Scars kind of suit me.
The gardener's son was standing by
A stiff drink would warm my feet up.
I'll get you for that!
They're gonna make a stink.
There's nothing we can't fix!
It's gonna blow up!
The Fascists' prisoners are going to escape!
Do you want a smack on the ear?
Soon the whole pack will be on us!
Ouch! It stings!
Hey, come on! Get up! We've almost reached the forest!
That's just bad luck.
This man and woman were captured in our village!
There's nothing we can do to help them.
And, in doing so, we proved once and for all that we're a fully operative partisan unit.
This is a great honor for all of us.
That was a dangerous task.
This wasn't the plan.
This is for my mom and dad!
We're harder to crack than peasant women, eh?
That's about right, but the enemy is well-organized and far more savage than us.
I don't think so. They've not found our base.
Not wrong. Except there's only one stone bridge around here, and it's heavily guarded.
For them, it's a matter of honor.
Isn't it that the cannon that Biermeier blabbed about?
That's gotta sting!
What kind of person would turn to the Fascists and bully their own people?
He is the Commandant of the camp that Nikolay and I escaped from.
Is that blood?
This will come in handy.
It's mine.
Huh, that's what I call a lucky find.
There's nothing funny in it!
The German bomber missed its target. Hit the house instead of the station.
He collects taxes and sends his soldiers to plunder villages.
Look at him now though, how cheeky he is.
They will help us plan future operations. And one more thing...
This will help.
This won't heal by itself.
It must be Trofim's? He's a hunter?
Is he the Potato Fuehrer that the village head shrieked about before dying?
That's lack of sleep showing. I lost sleep over my dad. I'm worried about him, he's a colonel, you know.
Doubts aren’t that bad. They’re what stops fools rushing in.
That's a Junkers. I saw our fighter shoot it down.
This must be the semaphore controls.
Not good enough. Let's hang him on the gallows. I want him to dance in the noose he tied for us!
Eliminated.
I didn't plan for this!
That was the last one.
One down.
The war's over for this one.
This is the last one. We've got the papers.
I feel sorry for her. So young and pretty...
I'm fine, but my father...
I'm telling Olga! She'll kick your ass for this.
I can't take it any longer.
I wouldn't respond to that if I were you. 
Don't be in such a hurry. This may be the last time we see the sky.
I'm in!
I keep my submachine gun there. I picked it up on the battlefield, but never had the courage to use it.
I went to that school. Five kilometers there and back again every day.
I'll get my revenge!
I owe you my life! Thank you!
I'll only slow you down. Go. I'll see you when things settle.
I told them to stay put until I return.
I saw an armored car in the backyard. We could drive it through the gates.
Comrade Commander, I know we need recruits, but... the man’s a criminal! How can we trust him?
All my bullets are gone!
I grew up listening to his stories, yearning to become a soldier.
Always ready!
I have to take care of my health.
I must help the injured comrade.
I saved him from a wolves in the forest. They chased him up a tree and prowled around waiting for him to fall.
I've been ready all night! Just waiting for you now!
Hey, I didn’t put a step wrong!
I told you: you won't see the sunrise.
I’ve lived more than sixty years, but I never imagined people could do such a thing.
I'll row.
I'm confused. Who are the good guys, the Polizei or the partisans?
I know what I'm doing.
I'm working as fast as I can!
Suppressing fire!
I guaranteed Biermeier that everything would be finished today.
Don't forget, I'm a nurse, not a doctor!
I shot a bear on this very spot, long before they built a sawmill here.
I was looking forward to see him again.
I'm not yet deaf.
Wrong time and place for romance.
I wasn't crying.
I won't let you down, I promise!
I haven't seen any.
My comrades need me.
I'm true to my word. But we're facing a dangerous enemy, so... Any volunteers?
I'm hurt.
Hey! I'm wou... wounded.
I've been doing my best to keep him placated. He has every power to string me up.
I took a bullet!
I can do it.
I can do it!
I can make it.
I haven't seen such insignia in my life. Is he a general or something?
I'll show you 'the weaker sex'!
I can do this all day.
Come 'ere!
I got encircled by enemy forces, but was lucky I’d held onto my radio and I stumbled upon a partisan unit.
Like I said to Sanek once, “Fortresses rise from a single rock”. Seems you weren’t listening.
I was about to head home, and then I thought, why not take a peek in the boxes near the crashed plane?
I've been on Zobel's trail for a while now. Couldn't miss a chance to lure the fox out of its hole.
I can't remember the last time there was butter on the table.
I'd like to help the townsfolk more.
I wanna be useful!
Am I hit?
I can smell those vermin from here.
Well, you know, I'm a hard worker, a Stakhanovite. I used to work at a factory.
I'm the commander. I can't afford the slightest doubt to set in. It is my duty to keep the group's spirits high.
I must be dreaming...
Snitch!
He was out looking for berries. The boy was thin as a match stick!
Like a pig!
I see.
I see. His time will come.
I see. We'll have to carry you then.
Got it, thanks.
Aye, I'm an orphan, too. Never knew my mom she left right after I were born.
