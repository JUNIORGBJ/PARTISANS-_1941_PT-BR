You're scaring the kid.
...But then I’d have to fight the Fascists in my pants!
I could do with another injury...
Could have done without this!
And I've just polished my boots.
I was just getting started!
There’s a reward: one thousand rubles to whoever helps arrest the fugitives.
And anyone who assists the wanted men will be executed.
My aim is good!
The alarm! The Sergeant must have started the riot.
I've been practicing since I was little. My dad took me to the shooting range on weekends.
Trofim, has your family been evacuated?
Hush!
Got a dugout, a medical tent, and a storage room.
There are mines here.
There's a lock.
It’s an enemy trap.
There's no one there.
It's too dangerous here.
This is a former pioneer camp. I spent last summer here.
This is where I dug trenches.
I'm here.
You will pay!
Don't push me!
You'd better think hard before you answer.
You've proved capable. You may join us, but you must obey orders, got it?
Planning on settling down here forever?
Are you trying to set me up, you, bastard?
What, haven't you heard the gunshots?
Pah! Young people these days! Listen, there's a stash near the swamp past the fence.
I spit on your grave!
There's the prison archives. Let's burn 'em up!
You have a red cross on your sleeve. Are you from the hospital? We came to help. I hope, it's not too late.
You don't stand a chance against the might of Germany. We, Aryans, are born to rule the likes of you.
War or no war, lunch must never be late. That's the German way.
Pops has a dugout in the forest. The Germans won't find us there.
Anyone got ammo?
Wait, I still had ammunition left!
I had a ? minus in Russian. Almost got myself kicked out of the pioneers because of it.
I'm a master of shooting sports.
I'll need to contact Moscow soon. Captain, you were keeping score of equipment destroyed, officers killed and the rest, I hope?
Me too, but it didn't stop me from working in a newspaper.
With a couple of trophy bottles, stashed away for an occasion like this.
Nights are long back home in Siberia.
We're on a mission.
We have work to do.
The Fascists have thousands of 'em. One tank is nothing. Why didn't we blow up the bridge or something?
Kill zeir commander Zorin and you receive big reward from ze Kommandant!
Hands off!
Murderers!
Thugs! Murderers!
Bastards...
Killed him.
AA threat is neutralized.
Uh-huh.
Yep. My dad was killed in the first month of the war.
Yeah. His creepy smile gives me chills.
Aha.
Much better.
The communication facility is on the other side.
If I find out who damaged that vehicle, I'll make 'em sorry they were born!
Eh, that hit me.
I think a bee stung me.
Get back, you fool! I'll blow your stupid head off!
Dropped one!
Dropped 'im!
You're a good commander, Comrade Captain. You're not the only career officer in your family, right?
If we destroy it, it'll complicate their job of identifying potential partisans and underground agents.
We'll wipe you out!
Kill the Fascist filth!
Hurray for partisans!
Yay!
Hurray! We did it!
Yay, we did it!
Too tired... I can't...
Planting the charge. It’s gonna blow soon!
He's out.
Let's give them a surprise.
You squirm too much.
Phew, that feels much better.
Ugh, pig!
Not this again!.. Now we need a key.
Ugh...
Ha! The tongue ever turns to the aching tooth. Let's go, Valya. Cleaning and examination can wait.
Ack!
You godless bastards!
Got me bad!
I'm so angry!
That's a strong one.
Ugh... I'm blacking out.
Teacher
Watch and learn!
A lesson for all of you.
Watch and learn.
The bastard smelled me.
I can't believe my ears. Is that our Olga?
He's a shady character. Heard he used to sell stuff under the counter.
Your Vaterland won't forget you.
Not a Fascist dog in sight.
The Fascists are using it as a warehouse. We must sneak inside and get that banner back.
The Fascists drove the people to the bridge. Together, we should be strong enough to liberate them.
Ferstehen. Your mines aren't going anywhere.
